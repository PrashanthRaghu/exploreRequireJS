# Explore as I Learn guide to Require.JS - Prashanth Raghu

## Why are you here ?
Do not know anything about RequireJS but everyone's jumping on the bandwagon or heard about it at a recent hackathon ? Want to impress your manager with some awesome cool stuff ?

### What RequireJS is not ?
Wanna beautify your page or wanting to add some animation/slideshows to your html5 mobile app ? RequireJS is just not what you wished it was. While it adds no functionality to your page/app it helps organizing and maintaining it on the long run. So wanna just beautify your page, now is the time to close this browser tab.

### What is it to a layman developer like me ?
Programmed with Java before ? (I hope you did else it's kinda difficult to explain) 
One really cool feature about java is that it lets you organize your application as modules and seperates the scope through packaging. So a File from java.io.File is totally independant from a File object I defined under my.prashanth.test.File as long as the developer chooses the right package to import. Can you do it with Javascript ? Yes to a limited extent but not as succicntly as you would in Java. So requireJS is a javascript module loader which helps developers modularize js apps and help manage dependancies. So think of it as your class loader + package manager from Java. ( Got it ? No: Trust me it is. )

### What I understood ?
Baaaaah :P What on earth does that mean ? 

## Time to dig into code. 
So how do you generally import a
